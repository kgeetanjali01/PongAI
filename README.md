Pong AI with NEAT Algorithm
This project demonstrates an AI agent learning to play the classic game Pong using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies) algorithm. NEAT evolves neural networks over generations, optimizing the AI's gameplay strategy by adjusting network topologies and weights through natural selection.

Project Overview
1. Objective: Enable the AI to improve its Pong skills autonomously through reinforcement learning, starting from random gameplay.
2. Algorithm: NEAT evolves neural networks by adjusting structure and connections, optimizing each generation based on performance.
3. Core Libraries:
   - pygame for game simulation
   - NEAT-Python for evolutionary algorithms
